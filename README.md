Final application for iOS decal

Musicator is an application designed for musicians, dancers, and anyone else who works with music. By letting clients play specific segments on repeat with the option to change playback rate, Musicator offers clients the opportunity to enhance their musical experience. We used AVFoundation and AVPlayer to handle client requests. Our current app is in a prototyping stage, and requires input of local music files. The next iteration will feature integration of APIâ€™s from popular music platforms, such as Spotify, Soundcloud, or Apple Music.
